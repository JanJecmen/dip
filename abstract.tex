R is a dynamic programming language that, despite being over 20 years old, is still widely used. RIR is an alternative to its bytecode compiler and interpreter that aims to facilitate adding static analyses and optimization passes easily. RIR is under development and does not currently match the performance of standard R. This thesis attempts to amend the situation. It extends the RIR internal representation, adds new features to its compiler and refactors its interpreter. The average slowdown versus standard R is brought down by about one half in the Shootout benchmarks.
